# Collection Types?

Primitive types are the foundational types provided by the ddl, and are also known as built-in types or fundamental types for other languages.

In the case of the ddl these types are not meant to store data. They're simply placeholders, or in case of the ddl being used for code generation of a target architecture meant to match the types of the target.

There are several categories of primitive types:

- General
    - any

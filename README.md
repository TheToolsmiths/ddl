# ddl

Data Definition Language for Game Development Tools

ddl is a DSL for describing data structures, but unlike using programming languages (like C, C++, C#), it can be parsed more efficiently.

It can be used for:
* data-driven type systems, where data structures are completely decoupled from compilation
* code generation systems, where code is generated from the DSL and compiled into a program
* hybrid systems where some types are data-driven and others are coupled
